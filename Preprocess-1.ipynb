That\\'s pretty much the point\\ninvestors reached after the Sept. 11\\nattacks. Expectations for third-quarter\\nprofits are now so negative that even mediocre reports count\\nas good news. In fact, the results that have come out in the\\npast few days -- particularly for some of the financials and\\ndrug companies -- are better than mediocre.\\n\\nI continue to be somewhat more optimistic than many\\neconomists. I believe that the Federal Reserve\\'s enormous\\ninterest-rate cuts will fuel an upturn in the economy -- and\\nthat the rate cuts would already be taking effect were it not\\nfor the economic damage stemming from Sept. 11. Fears of\\nfurther terrorism continue to undermine the market,\\novershadowing faint signs of improving fundamentals. As a\\nresult, the Dow was down 151 points on Wednesday, despite\\nseveral strong earnings reports.\\n\\nFreddie Mac (FRE: down $0.44 to $66.65, Research,\\nEstimates)  reported a 26 percent earnings gain for the third\\nquarter. That follows Fannie Mae\\'s (FNM: down $0.73 to\\n$80.85, Research, Estimates)  strong report, which I\\ndiscussed in Monday\\'s column (see \"A lender\\'s market\").\\nCitigroup (C: up $0.47 to $46.56, Research, Estimates)\\nannounced a 9 percent decline in third-quarter earnings after\\nexpenses related to last month\\'s attacks. Without the\\nunexpected charges, Citigroup would have posted a\\ndouble-digit gain, and the company projects 15 percent\\ngrowth in the fourth quarter. J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM: up\\n$0.66 to $34.60, Research, Estimates) announced a 68\\npercent drop in earnings -- but the results were in line with\\nanalysts\\' reduced forecasts.\\n\\nThe strongest sector this fall may well turn out to be\\npharmaceuticals. Two leading companies reported strong\\nresults on Wednesday. Pfizer, the world\\'s leading drugmaker,\\nturned in a stunning 28 percent profit gain for the third\\nquarter, confirming the company\\'s status as the must-own\\nchoice in the industry. Blockbuster products such as\\nanti-cholesterol drug Lipitor helped fuel sales, while cost\\ncutting in the wake of last year\\'s Warner-Lambert acquisition\\nbolstered profit margins. Solid but less flamboyant gains were\\nannounced by Johnson & Johnson, where third-quarter\\nearnings gained nearly 16 percent.\\n\\nA few bright spots don\\'t add up to a fireworks display, but\\nthere are two pieces of conventional wisdom worth keeping in\\nmind right now. The first is that the direction of the market\\ndepends on how profit trends compare with expectations.\\nThe bad news has already been factored into stock prices.\\nWhat matters from here on is not whether results are good,\\nbut whether they\\'re not as bad as feared.\\n\\nThe other fact to remember is the importance of\\ndiversification. The greatest upside leverage when the\\neconomy recovers will probably be among the big-cap tech\\nstocks. But drug stocks are equally important parts of a\\nwell-balanced growth portfolio.\\n\\nJ&J\\'s (JNJ: up $1.00 to $57.77, Research, Estimates)  13\\npercent long-term annual growth rate and broad\\ndiversification within health-care makes it an appealing choice\\nfor conservative investors. At $58 a share, the stock trades\\nat 26 times next year\\'s projected results. But it may be\\nsmarter to pay up a little more for Pfizer (PFE: up $0.55 to\\n$41.65, Research, Estimates). At $41.65, the shares are\\ntrading at 28 times projected earnings for 2002. That\\'s not a\\ncheap P/E, but it\\'s a small premium to pay for the No. 1\\ncompany in the industry with a core growth rate of nearly 20\\npercent a year.\\n\\n###\\n\\nRead all of Michael\\'s columns at:\\nhttp://money.cnn.com/markets/sivy/\\n\\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks, go to:\\nhttp://money.cnn.com/email/\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------\\nSPECIAL OFFER - MONEY MAGAZINE PERSONAL FINANCE COACHING SYSTEM\\nTap the expertise of MONEY for your specific personal finance\\nneeds with the help of a one-to-one coach...
