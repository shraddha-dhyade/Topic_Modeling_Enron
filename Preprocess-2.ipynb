In fact, the results that have come out in the\n","past few days -- particularly for some of the financials and\n","drug companies -- are better than mediocre.\n","\n","I continue to be somewhat more optimistic than many\n","economists.

Fears of\n","further terrorism continue to undermine the market,\n","overshadowing faint signs of improving fundamentals. As a\n","result, the Dow was down 151 points on Wednesday, despite\n","several strong earnings reports.\n","\n","Freddie Mac (FRE: down $0.44 to $66.65, Research,\n","Estimates)  reported a 26 percent earnings gain for the third\n","quarter. That follows Fannie Mae's (FNM: down $0.73 to\n","$80.85, Research, Estimates)  strong report, which I\n","discussed in Monday's column (see \"A lender's market\").\n","Citigroup (C: up $0.47 to $46.56, Research, Estimates)\n","announced a 9 percent decline in third-quarter earnings after\n","expenses related to last month's attacks. Without the\n","unexpected charges, Citigroup would have posted a\n","double-digit gain, and the company projects 15 percent\n","growth in the fourth quarter. J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM: up\n","$0.66 to $34.60, Research, Estimates) announced a 68\n","percent drop in earnings -- but the results were in line with\n","analysts' reduced forecasts.\n","\n","The strongest sector this fall may well turn out to be\n","pharmaceuticals. Two leading companies reported strong\n","results on Wednesday. Pfizer, the world's leading drugmaker,\n","turned in a stunning 28 percent profit gain for the third\n","quarter, confirming the company's status as the must-own\n","choice in the industry. Blockbuster products such as\n","anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor helped fuel sales, while cost\n","cutting in the wake of last year's Warner-Lambert acquisition\n","bolstered profit margins. Solid but less flamboyant gains were\n","announced by Johnson & Johnson, where third-quarter\n","earnings gained nearly 16 percent.\n","\n","A few bright spots don't add up to a fireworks display, but\n","there are two pieces of conventional wisdom worth keeping in\n","mind right now.
