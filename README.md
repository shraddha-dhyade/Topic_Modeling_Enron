# Topic_Modeling_Enron
Processed and cleaned Enron email data to form a dataset. Performed topic modeling to filter out relevant emails from junk emails. Used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, bag of words model, clustering to identify top senders, establish a network of senders and receivers and identify the subjects/topics, which could aid in fraud detection.
